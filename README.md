                                  ### Diamonds vs Hexagons
## Introduction

**Diamonds vs Hexagons** is a game inspired by "Plants vs Zombies" but with a simplified geometric approach. In this game, you'll face hexagonal enemies invading your territory, and you must defend against them using strategically placed diamonds that launch projectiles. The game features a grid-based layout with three rows and three columns, where you'll strategically place your diamonds to counter the incoming hexagons.

## Gameplay

The game takes place on a grid with three rows and three columns. Hexagonal enemies will appear randomly on the right side of the grid and move towards the left side. Your objective is to defend against these enemies by placing diamonds on the grid. Each diamond can launch projectiles that damage the hexagons. If a hexagon reaches the left side of the grid, you lose a life. You start with three lives, and losing all of them results in losing the game.

## Diamonds and Projectiles

You have the option to place diamonds on the grid to combat the hexagons. Each diamond costs a certain number of stars, which appear randomly on the grid and must be collected by the player. Diamonds can launch projectiles that damage hexagons. Each diamond can only damage a specific type of hexagon based on its color.

## GUI

The game's graphical user interface (GUI) displays important information such as the number of remaining lives, the number of stars collected, and the cost of each diamond type. It also allows you to select diamond types and place them on the grid.
